**Introduction**
This assignment focuses on exploring and visualizing two distinct datasets, "Frailty" and "Student Performance," using Google Colab. The goal is to leverage various data visualization techniques to gain insights into the characteristics of each dataset.

**Requirements**
To run the notebooks and visualize the data, you need:

Google Colab account
Access to the provided datasets
Basic understanding of Python and data visualization
Getting Started
Open Google Colab.
Create a new notebook.
Upload the datasets or provide access to the datasets in your Colab environment.
Run the cells in the notebooks to generate visualizations.
**> **Data Sets**
1. Frailty Dataset**
The "Frailty" dataset consists of several variables, including Height (in inches), Weight (in pounds), Age, Grip strength (in kilograms), and Frailty status (categorized as 'Y' for Yes and 'N' for No). The dataset appears to capture physical and demographic characteristics of individuals, with a specific focus on assessing frailty, likely used for research or analysis in the context of health and aging. The Frailty variable indicates whether an individual is classified as frail ('Y') or not ('N') based on certain criteria.

2. Student Performance Dataset
The "Student Performance" dataset contains information about students, including their gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, test preparation course completion, and scores in math, reading, and writing. The dataset appears to be used for analyzing factors influencing student academic performance, with the 'Total score' column providing a cumulative score for each student based on their performance in the three subjects. The variables in the dataset offer insights into demographics, educational background, and the impact of preparation on overall student achievement.
